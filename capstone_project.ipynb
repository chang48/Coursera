    "An investor is looking to open a new restaurant in San Francisco, but he is not sure about the best location for his new venue and needs input for making the decision. San Francisco is rather busy city famous for its business innovation and several famous tourit attractions. So while it looks promising to set up a new restaurant business in San Francisco, the venue's location must be carefully picked in order to maximize the profit. According to <a href=\"https://www.foodnewsfeed.com/fsr/vendor-bylines/8-factors-choosing-new-restaurant-location\">an analysis</a> in the FSR Magazine, the 8 factors for choosing a new restaurant location are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visibility - look for foot and car traffic patterns that can give the venue the best visibility.\n",
    "2. Parking - need to have sufficient parking space for customers.\n",
    "3. Space size - consider how big of a space one needs for restaurant requirements.\n",
    "4. Crime rates - avoid crime-laden areas in the city.\n",
    "5. Surrounding businesses and competitor analysis - know what types of restaurant would do well in a certain area. Know what will distinguish a new restaurant from competitors.\n",
    "6. Acessibility - keep in mind about things like off-the-hightway locations, locations near busy intersections.\n",
    "7. Affordability - the cost of the venue space (rental or purchase) is a bottom-line consideration for any business.\n",
    "8. Safety - workplace safty is important for the restaurant owner as well as workers.\n",

    "In the capstone project, we will get the help from FourSquare API to address these considerations. "
