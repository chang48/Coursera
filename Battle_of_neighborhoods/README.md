# Battle of the Neighborhood 

An investor is looking to open a new restaurant in San Francisco, but he 
is not sure about the best location for his new venue and needs input for
 making the decision. San Francisco is a busy city famous for its business 
innovations and tourit attractions. So, while it seems promising to set up 
a new restaurant business in San Francisco, the venue's location must be 
carefully picked in order to maximize the profit. 

In this project, we address the question of choosing a new restaurant location
directly using data science analysis. Through the use of publicly available 
data in conjunction with a location search engine and a clustering algorithm, 
we can come up with reasonable recommendations.

Key words: Clustering algorithm, Pandas, GeoPandas, Folium visualization
