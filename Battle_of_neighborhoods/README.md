# Battle of the Neighborhood 

An investor is looking to open a new restaurant in San Francisco, but he 
is not sure about the best location for his new venue and needs input for
 making the decision. San Francisco is a busy city famous for its business 
innovation and famous tourit attractions. So, while it looks promising to 
set up a new restaurant business in San Francisco, the venue's location 
must be carefully picked in order to maximize the profit. 

In this project, we address the question: how do you choose a new restaurant 
location? By using publicly available data, a location search engine, and a 
clustering algorithm, we can come up with a reasonable recommendation for new
restaurant locations using data science analysis.
